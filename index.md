### üîç [Fraud Detection Model](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)

**Tech Stack:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
**Dataset:** [Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)

This project explores the classification of fraudulent online transactions using basic machine learning models. The dataset includes anonymized features for 500,000 credit card transactions labeled as fraud or non-fraud.

- Conducted data cleaning and feature inspection to prepare for modeling  
- Visualized class imbalance and model performance with charts  
- Trained and compared Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers  
- Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Presented findings in a clear PDF report with supporting visualizations
