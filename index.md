## Portfolio


### [Fraud Detection Model](https://minimius.notion.site/Fraud-Detection-Model-13717dec8f31814aa396c6e9a702ca61)

**Tech Stack:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, Logistic Regression  
**Dataset:** [Synthetic Credit Card Fraud Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)

This project simulates a real-world fraud detection scenario by applying machine learning algorithms to synthetic financial transaction data. The dataset mimics mobile money transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent activity.

- Explored and cleaned over 500,000 transaction records to understand fraud patterns
- Performed feature engineering and scaled numerical features for model input
- Applied Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest classifiers and XGBoost Modelling.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Presented findings in a clear PDF report with supporting visualizations
